# MATOI（纏）

**MATOI** (formerly **Huroshiki**) brings multiple Packwiz modpacks and reusable
MOD-list templates into one coherent management workflow. Its name, 纏 (matoi),
reflects wrapping and unifying different elements.

The public interfaces are:

- `matoi` for interactive project management (preferred)
- `huroshiki` as the backwards-compatible interactive command
- `packctl` for noninteractive commands and automation (unchanged)
- `just` for repository development tasks only

Every noninteractive project-specific operation takes an explicit pack or template ID. Collection
commands such as `list` and `validate` do not select a project, and there is no `MODPACK` shell
context.

## Installation

Run or install MATOI using its Nix flake:

```bash
nix run github:upiscium/MATOI -- --help
nix profile install github:upiscium/MATOI#matoi
matoi --help
packctl --help
matoi --version
huroshiki --version  # legacy compatibility
packctl --version
```

The current main/source version is `0.3.1-dev`. The latest published stable release is `v0.3.1`
(released under the former Huroshiki name), which can be run with:

```bash
nix run github:upiscium/MATOI/v0.3.1 -- --help
```

The managed repository is selected by `--root PATH`, then the existing `HUROSHIKI_ROOT`
environment variable, then the current working directory. Both `matoi` and `huroshiki`
accept `--root` before or after `--pack`/`--template`; `packctl` requires global options
before its subcommand. The installed program location is never used as the data root.

```bash
matoi --root /srv/modpacks
HUROSHIKI_ROOT=/srv/modpacks packctl validate
packctl --root /srv/modpacks list
```

**Compatibility:** Existing `huroshiki` invocations, `packctl` scripts, Nix's
`#huroshiki` attribute, `HUROSHIKI_ROOT`, the `.huroshiki/` transaction directory,
and stored `.huroshiki-*.json` metadata remain unchanged. Do not rename these files or
directories in existing packs; MATOI reads the original on-disk formats.

For repository development, enter the pinned shell with `direnv allow` or `nix develop`.
Just is available there for `just test-matoi` (or the legacy `just test-huroshiki`)
and `just check`; it is not in the package runtime closure.

Do not edit `packs/*/dist/`; each build replaces both distributions. Packwiz metadata must declare
`side = "client"`, `"server"`, or `"both"`.

Content overlays may contain only ordinary files and directories. Symlinks are rejected without
following them, and Packwiz-owned names (`pack.toml`, `index.toml`, and `*.pw.toml`) belong only in
`source/`; validation and builds reject those case-sensitive Packwiz names anywhere under
`content/common|client|server`.

Packwiz `source/` trees likewise may contain only ordinary files and directories. Validation and
runtime transactions reject every symlink and special filesystem entry before copying or running
Packwiz, including dangling, internal, absolute, and escaping links.

## Interactive Use

Open the project browser or one project directly:

```bash
matoi
matoi --pack the-fungal-infection
matoi --template delight-base
```

The TUI creates packs and templates, composes multiple templates, installs and removes MODs, edits
sides and individual UTF-8 content-overlay files, builds, previews deployments, publishes, and
manages retained state. This basic file editor does not provide directory moves, binary import/export,
multi-file transactions, or dedicated KubeJS management.
Template composition matches Minecraft and loader type, resolves current compatible files for the
new pack's loader version, preserves template order, and unions sides for identical provider IDs.
Every Packwiz root added through the TUI, CLI, a profile, or template composition is resolved in an
isolated temporary project. Its requested side applies to the complete dependency closure, including
dependencies whose metadata was already installed and would not otherwise change. Metadata merges
use canonical provider/project identity, preserve existing locations, union sides, and reject
version/download/update disagreements plus portable metadata-path or JAR-filename collisions. URL
roots continue to use bounded downloads and do not acquire an implicit Packwiz dependency closure.
Modrinth IDs, slugs, and project URLs are resolved through the Modrinth API before Packwiz runs.
CurseForge uses Packwiz-native interactive search in the TUI; MATOI does not directly search the
CurseForge API, and a CurseForge API key is unnecessary. Results display labels only; MATOI
verifies the selected root's positive numeric project ID with an isolated root-only probe, then
resolves and merges its canonical complete dependency closure. `provider_lookup.py` is Modrinth-only.
Noninteractive CLI, profile, and template
selectors require positive numeric CurseForge IDs; names, slugs, and URLs fail closed. Bare Modrinth
input is always a search query, including a single word; use `mr:<ID-or-slug>` or a Modrinth project
URL for exact lookup.
Packwiz and provider resolver work use isolated process groups, so the same cancellation, absolute
deadline, and orphan-process checks bound their work. Packwiz menu labels are never interpreted as
identities.
When Modrinth and CurseForge resolve the same transitive dependency to a colliding metadata path or
JAR filename, MATOI collapses it only after verified identity equivalence. Equal declared SHA-256 is
accepted directly; otherwise the pinned Packwiz Installer materializes both artifacts in isolated
transaction state, verifies each declared hash, and requires equal computed SHA-256 or the same
complete target-loader MOD ID/version set. Names, slugs, and filenames alone are never evidence. Explicit
root pairs, URL artifacts, mismatched versions/loaders, and unverifiable artifacts remain conflicts.
Legacy Packs without `.huroshiki-roots.json` may safely retain existing metadata when an incoming
verified equivalent is known to be a transitive dependency; sides are unioned and no root manifest
is inferred or created. Ambiguous collisions with an incoming explicit root remain rejected.
Noninteractive Modrinth and CurseForge closure resolvers run in isolated process groups: cancellation
or their monotonic deadline stops the whole group with SIGTERM and then SIGKILL after a bounded grace
period. URL roots keep their existing interruptible download cancellation and network timeouts; the
Packwiz resolver deadline does not replace the URL download timeout.
After a resolver parent exits, MATOI also checks the Linux process table for live members of its
process group. Background descendants are terminated and make the resolver result fail closed;
zombie-only groups are not treated as running work. Termination, forced killing, and parent reaping
each have bounded waits; an undrained group or unreaped parent is reported as an integrity failure.

### Navigation

The Project screen is the hub for an opened pack or template. `Esc` from Install, Installed MODs,
Update, or Project files returns to that Project screen. `Esc` from the Project screen returns to
the Main Menu. A file editor returns to Project files; unsaved edits require discard confirmation.
Creation candidate and conflict screens remain inside their creation flow. Project files opened as
a recovery action for a broken pack return to the Main Menu because that Project cannot be opened.

The Install screen remains active until cancellation and rollback of running Packwiz work completes.
Previously staged changes are kept in the project transaction until applied or explicitly discarded.

### Side Controls

Use these keys where side editing is available, including Install defaults, staged changes,
Installed MODs, Template MODs, and invalid-side repair:

```text
Ctrl+C    toggle client
Ctrl+S    toggle server
b         enable both client and server
```

Bare `c` and `s` do not change sides. Side shortcuts do not run while an Input or TextArea owns
focus, so copy, save, and text editing keep their widget behavior.

Textual 8 enters raw terminal mode and disables `ISIG`, `IXON`, and `IXOFF` while the application is
active, allowing `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+S` to arrive as key events. It restores the original termios
state when the application exits. If `TEXTUAL_ALLOW_SIGNALS` is set, or a terminal multiplexer
intercepts control characters first, `Ctrl+C` may remain SIGINT and `Ctrl+S` may remain XOFF.

## Packctl

List and inspect projects:

```bash
packctl list
packctl list-templates
packctl show the-fungal-infection
packctl validate
packctl validate-for the-fungal-infection
packctl validate-template delight-base
```

Create and modify projects:

```bash
packctl new demo "Demo Pack" 1.21.1 neoforge 21.1.234
packctl new-template industrial-base "Industrial Base" 1.21.1 neoforge 21.1.234
packctl add demo mr:create both
packctl add demo url:https://mods.example/private-mod.jar server
packctl remove demo create
packctl side demo mods/create.pw.toml both
packctl profile demo base performance
packctl update demo --build
```

Multiple profile names are applied in the declared order as one transaction. A
failed resolve, closure merge, or refresh leaves the pack's real `source/` unchanged.

Profiles preserve legacy ordered `{source, project, side}` entries and also accept optional
`artifact_id` and `scope` (`root`, the default, or `dependency`). Root entries require a valid
side; dependency entries require an artifact and must not specify a side. CurseForge IDs are
positive canonical decimal IDs, while exact Modrinth entries use immutable 8-character project
and artifact IDs. Validation is local configuration validation only: it performs no provider
catalog lookup and does not synchronize Packwiz pins. This schema does not cover Template Import,
candidate browsing, or Packwiz pin synchronization.

`packctl update` is fail-closed: if any resolver fails, it applies no candidates and returns the
first resolver error code (or `1`). `--allow-partial` explicitly applies only resolvable candidates
and returns `2`; `--build` is skipped after that partial result. The TUI keeps resolver failures
unavailable while allowing the user to review and explicitly select successful candidates.
Update candidate preparation runs off the Textual event loop and reports normalization plus
per-MOD progress. One cancellation event covers baseline refresh and every resolver; a 10-minute
operation deadline bounds the complete preparation while each resolver remains capped at 2 minutes.
The same cancellation and deadline checkpoints cover the initial transaction snapshot, source copy,
normalization copies, and content snapshots; partial disposable copies are removed on interruption.
The worker publishes progress through a queue that the Textual event loop polls; it does not call
back into Textual or get joined by the event loop. Esc returns to the Project screen only after the
operation has completed process cleanup and discarded its transaction.

Serve locally or publish:

```bash
packctl serve demo --port 8080  # listens on 127.0.0.1
packctl publish demo --preview
packctl publish demo --yes
```

`publish` is the sole publication operation. It creates one immutable, network-free plan, displays
the Pack, side, publication endpoint, generation, file/byte counts, warnings, and restart target,
then activates exactly that plan after confirmation. Use `--preview` to stop after planning, or
`--yes` for noninteractive use. Publication activates a verified generation before attempting the
configured restart; restart failures are reported without an automatic retry, and the plan's
cleanup is retried at most once. `serve` builds first and serves `packs/<id>/dist/` on loopback
until interrupted.

The old `build`, `build-all`, `deploy`, `deploy-dry-run`, `deploy-all`, and `restart` commands have
been retired. Use `packctl publish <pack>`, optionally with `--preview` or `--yes`; `packctl serve`
remains available for local serving.

Trash and retained state:

```bash
packctl trash-list
packctl trash-restore 20260723-120000-000000-pack-example
packctl trash-purge 20260723-120000-000000-pack-example
packctl clean-huroshiki-state
packctl clean-huroshiki-state --older-than 14 --keep 5 --project pack:example
packctl clean-huroshiki-state --apply --older-than 14 --project pack:example
```

State cleanup is a dry run unless `--apply` is supplied. Active transactions and locks are never
selected for deletion. A successful pack transaction retains its replaced source as a rollback
snapshot under the completed transaction; normal completed-state retention removes that snapshot.

## Local Configuration

Committed manifests define project identity and Packwiz/template semantics. Ignored local files are
only for machine-local operational settings; both runtime loading and `packctl validate` reject all
other keys.

`pack.local.yaml` recursively overrides only these settings:

```yaml
distribution:
  rsync_target: user@host:/srv/packs/demo
  public_pack_url: https://packs.example/demo/pack.toml
minecraft_server:
  ssh_host: user@host
  stack_dir: /srv/demo
  service: demo
url_max_jar_size_bytes: 268435456
url_allow_private_networks: false
```

The exact allowed paths are `distribution.rsync_target`, `distribution.public_pack_url`,
`minecraft_server.ssh_host`,
`minecraft_server.stack_dir`, `minecraft_server.service`, `url_max_jar_size_bytes`, and
`url_allow_private_networks`. Identity,
display, enablement, Minecraft/loader versions, MOD data, and every unknown top-level or nested key
are prohibited in `pack.local.yaml`.

Deployment targets are validated for their eventual command usage. SSH targets accept a hostname,
an IPv4 address, a bracketed IPv6 address, and an optional `user@` prefix; option-like values,
whitespace, paths, command suffixes, and malformed brackets are rejected. Stack directories must be
normalized non-root POSIX absolute paths without `.` or `..` components. Compose service names may
contain only letters, digits, `_`, `.`, and `-`, and must start with a letter or digit. SSH execution
uses an explicit `--` option terminator.

For packs, open `Settings` and then `Deployment` in the TUI to edit the effective SSH host, stack
directory, Compose service, and the host/path components of the rsync target. Changes are reviewed
before they are written to `pack.local.yaml`; unchanged fields retain their committed or local
source. The equivalent noninteractive commands are `packctl show-deployment <pack>` and
`packctl set-deployment <pack> [options]`.

`Settings` then `Client Distribution` shows the effective Public Pack URL, whether it came from
committed or local configuration, and the Packwiz Installer command. Public Pack URLs must use
HTTPS, contain no credentials or fragment, and end in `/pack.toml`; query strings are allowed.
Use `packctl show-pack-url <pack> [--raw]`, `packctl set-pack-url <pack> <url>`, or
`packctl clear-pack-url <pack>`. Clearing removes only the local override, so a committed URL
becomes effective again.

`packctl loader-version <pack> <version|latest|recommended>` prepares a Packwiz loader migration
and prints the resulting loader version and changed files without modifying the real pack. Add
`--apply` to publish the reviewed transaction. Minecraft version and loader type remain fixed;
migration or refresh failures and concurrent pack changes leave the real source untouched.
The same flow is available under `Settings` then `Versions`; preparation runs in a background
worker, displays progress and changed files, and completes cancellation cleanup before navigation.

### Copy migration

`packctl migrate` is the Copy-only workflow for moving a Pack to a new Minecraft/loader target. It
never migrates in place and never copies deployment or Minecraft-server settings. The source Pack is
snapshotted before planning; source and target are locked in canonical order, and the target is
installed with an atomic no-clobber operation. An existing target is therefore rejected rather than
overwritten. Copy migration never modifies or commits to the source Pack. For a legacy Pack without
root provenance, migration-local root selection is explicit and is used only to resolve the target;
the successful target records canonical root provenance.

```bash
packctl migrate old-pack --copy-to new-pack --display-name "New Pack" \
  --minecraft 1.21.1 --loader neoforge --loader-version 21.1.234
packctl migrate old-pack --copy-to new-pack --display-name "New Pack" \
  --minecraft 1.21.1 --loader neoforge --loader-version 21.1.234 --apply
```

The loader must be one of `fabric`, `forge`, `neoforge`, or `quilt`. The default is a preview;
`--apply` publishes the reviewed target copy. Migration does not automatically build, deploy,
publish, or restart anything. A post-publication cleanup failure leaves the transaction and locks
retained as **cleanup pending**; retry or clean that retained state before treating the operation as
finished.

Root provenance is read from `source/.huroshiki-roots.json`. A Pack without that manifest does not
turn every installed dependency into a root: migration remains `resolution-required` until each
root is explicitly selected. This legacy selection is migration-local and does not change the source
Pack; the selected canonical roots are recorded in the successful target. Use repeated
`--root PROVIDER:ID` selections for roots. A legacy URL candidate without an identity uses `--root SOURCE_PATH=url:ID`. Use repeated `--remove ID`
choices for roots that should be dropped, and repeated `--replace OLD=PROVIDER:ID` choices for
canonical Modrinth or CurseForge replacements. `--remove` and `--replace` are only for the complete,
digest-bound unresolved set shown by the preview; stale, incomplete, non-canonical, or ambiguous
choices fail closed. `--ack-warning WARNING_CODE` must be repeated for every warning that requires
an acknowledgement. The global managed-repository
`--root PATH` remains a global option and must appear
before `migrate`, for example `packctl --root /srv/modpacks migrate ...`.

Migration preserves the source's exact MOD version intent from
`.huroshiki-version-overrides.json`, which remains authoritative. A locked source identity is a hard
constraint and cannot be silently replaced; an incompatible target resolution is rejected. Any
newly carried exact identity is unlocked by default. Exact dependency intent is retained only when
that dependency is required by a selected root; it is not promoted to a root and an unavailable or
conflicting dependency blocks migration. Review the complete root/dependency changes and required
warning acknowledgements before using `--apply`.

Template copy migration uses the preferred nested command:

```bash
packctl template migrate industrial-base --copy-to industrial-1-21-1 \
  --display-name "Industrial 1.21.1" --minecraft 1.21.1 \
  --loader neoforge --loader-version 21.1.234
```

It is preview-only unless `--apply` is supplied. Resolution choices use repeated
`--remove SOURCE_INDEX` or `--replace SOURCE_INDEX=PROVIDER:SELECTOR` (selectors may contain
additional colons); required warnings use repeated `--ack-warning CODE`.

`packctl apply-template <pack> <template> [<template> ...]` prepares a one-shot import into an
existing pack. The default is a dry run; `--apply` publishes the staged closure. Name, URL selector,
logical-identity replacement, and resolved-identity conflicts require a version 4 `--resolution`
YAML file containing the displayed plan digest, while identity side conflicts default to keeping the
installed pack side. All overlapping conflict choices form one global constraint set; contradictory
choices and removal without a selected Template replacement fail closed. Planning starts by locking
and copying the Pack transaction, and reads installed metadata only from that transaction source.
Resolution files select source options. Equivalent installed and Template origins with the same
selector and verified actual identity form one option, so name-conflict decisions include or exclude
every origin for that source. Distinct actual identities and failed verification remain separate
options. When an installed URL source exists, all replacement URLs share one exactly-one logical
identity conflict; selecting the installed option rejects every replacement. Selecting an unverified
Template option is rejected.
Template order, each complete URL, effective URL size/private-network policy, verification result,
resolved closure fingerprint, and the MOD identity verified from each URL JAR are bound into the
digest. A normal URL failure remains attached to that candidate so another candidate can be selected,
but selecting an unverified candidate fails before execution. Verified URL closures are reused,
addition and replacement are classified by actual identity, and all closures plus Packwiz refresh are
preflighted before the transaction is changed. Packwiz dependencies are shown separately, and no
persistent template association or content overlay is created.

The same one-shot workflow is available in the TUI: open an existing Pack, choose **Apply
Template**, select compatible Templates in the required order, resolve source-option and side
conflicts, then review explicit roots, dependencies, side changes, removals, unchanged sources,
warnings, and metadata changes before applying atomically. Planning and execution remain cancellable
background operations; leaving waits for resolver and transaction cleanup. Applying a Template this
way does not create a persistent Template association.

The resolved import is also a postcondition on the staged source. A selected root closure may not
require an actual identity removed by the resolution, and removed identities are checked again after
closure merge and after Packwiz refresh in both preflight and the transaction. Such a dependency
reintroduction fails before a preview and leaves the real Pack unchanged. Preview classes describe
the final staged result: `removed` roots are absent, `unchanged` roots are equivalent retained Pack
sources without side changes, and `added_roots`, `added_dependencies`, and `side_changes` are
disjoint changes from that retained state. Resolution files remain schema version 4.

The settings commands pin the managed collection and project directory, snapshot both committed and
local configuration, validate the prospective merged project entirely in memory, and publish through
Linux `renameat2` compare-and-swap. The directory identities are rechecked before and after
publication so a renamed or replaced project path fails closed. They do
not follow configuration symlinks or reopen a snapshotted file by path. A new local file is mode
`0600`; an existing file keeps its mode. Unsupported atomic rename semantics fail closed. If an
exchange detects an external writer at the canonical path, MATOI leaves it canonical and reports
separate original and staged recovery filenames.

`packctl show-url-policy <kind> <project>` reports effective values rather than `None`, including
whether each value came from `default`, `committed`, or `local`. The defaults are 256 MiB and
`url_allow_private_networks: false`.

## Template Format

Templates are YAML MOD lists, not Packwiz projects:

```yaml
id: industrial-base
display_name: Industrial Base
enabled: true
minecraft: 1.21.1
loader: neoforge
reference_loader_version: 21.1.234
mods:
  - name: Create
    provider: modrinth
    project_id: LNytGWDc
    side: both
  - name: JEI
    provider: curseforge
    project_id: "238222"
    side: client
```

Every field shown above, including `mods`, is required in committed `template.yaml`.
`template.local.yaml` permits two operational keys: a positive integer
`url_max_jar_size_bytes` and boolean `url_allow_private_networks`. It cannot define `id`,
`display_name`, `enabled`, `minecraft`, `loader`,
`reference_loader_version`, `mods`, or any unknown key. Template listing, composition, side changes,
and deletion always use and update committed semantic data in `template.yaml`; the local URL policy
is used only for bounded downloads. Changing either template configuration file while a staged
template transaction is open prevents that transaction from being applied.

### Template version intent

Committed Templates may also declare `mod_version_overrides`. Entries use immutable provider IDs
and an exact artifact/version ID; the scope is either `root` or `dependency`:

```yaml
mod_version_overrides:
  # No entry: this Template root is automatic (the compatible version is resolved).
  - provider: modrinth
    project_id: Abcd1234
    artifact_id: Efgh5678
    scope: root                 # exact root version
  - provider: curseforge
    project_id: "238222"
    artifact_id: "123456"
    scope: dependency            # exact required non-root dependency version
```

Modrinth project and artifact IDs must be immutable eight-character IDs. CurseForge project and
artifact IDs must be canonical positive decimal IDs. URL entries cannot carry version intent:
URLs have no provider artifact identity and remain bounded URL selections. A root override must
match exactly one Template `mods` entry; a dependency override must not appear in `mods` and is
valid only when that MOD is a required non-root dependency of a selected root.

During **Apply Template**, conflicts are resolved first. Only then are active root intents derived
from the selected candidates; dependency intents are retained only for required dependency edges.
The import reconstructs one final constraint set and resolves the complete selected root graph from
that set. It does not open a candidate browser or picker, and it does not synchronize Packwiz pins.

The Pack source file `.huroshiki-version-overrides.json` remains the Authority after import. Existing
locked Pack intent wins as a hard constraint: a conflicting Template exact artifact fails closed.
Newly imported intent is unlocked by default. Non-MOD metadata and Pack-only MODs are preserved;
Template Import does not infer ownership or remove them. The separate #80 migration work is out of
scope for this feature.

Any `templates/<id>/source` entry, including a symlink, is a validation error. Legacy Packwiz
template fallback and migration commands have been removed. Before upgrading, extract required
provider IDs and sides into `template.yaml`, add all required fields shown above, remove `source/`,
then run `packctl validate-template <id>`.

URL entries use `provider: url`, a stable logical `project_id`, and a public `.jar` URL. Downloads
default to 256 MiB; set `url_max_jar_size_bytes` in the committed manifest or its permitted local
configuration to change the limit. Every URL and redirect rejects non-public literal or resolved
addresses, including the well-known NAT64 prefixes, by default, and each connection is pinned to the
approved DNS result. `url_allow_private_networks: true` in ignored local configuration permits
intentional private, loopback, link-local, shared-address, and NAT64 access; unspecified, multicast,
reserved, documentation, and benchmarking ranges remain prohibited. This key is rejected in
committed manifests. When templates share one URL candidate, private access is allowed only if every
origin template opts in.

Generated Packwiz metadata paths and JAR filenames must also be portable across case-insensitive
filesystems: traversal, absolute/drive/UNC paths, control characters, Windows device names, trailing
dots/spaces, and Unicode/case-folded collisions are rejected.

## Zsh Completion

The package installs `_packctl`, `_matoi`, and the legacy `_huroshiki` in `share/zsh/site-functions`. They provide dynamic
pack, template, profile, metadata-path, and installed-MOD choices where applicable. MATOI does
not install `_just` and does not override the user's generic Just completion.

For a manually built package:

```zsh
package="$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#matoi)"
fpath=("$package/share/zsh/site-functions" $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

## Development Checks

```bash
just test-matoi
just check
actionlint
nix flake check
nix build .
nix build .#matoi
```

`nix flake check` includes the complete Python unit suite as a sandboxed derivation. GitHub pull
requests must pass the `checks` CI status before merging to `main`.
